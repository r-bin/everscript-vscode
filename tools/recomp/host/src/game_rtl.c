/*
 * Secret of Evermore: game-specific runtime glue for the snesrecomp host.
 * Ours (everscript-vscode, MIT). `npm run recomp` copies it over the scaffolded project's
 * src/game_rtl.c; edit it here, never in out/recomp/project/.
 *
 * What SoE needs from the host (docs/recomp/game-rtl.md):
 *   - Reset $80:8020 sets up the hardware, enables NMI + auto-joypad ($4200 = $81) and jumps to
 *     the main loop at $80:8B66, which never returns: the host cuts frames at vblank.
 *   - The NMI handler $80:823A copies the PPU shadows $7E0106-$0125 and counts frames in $7E0100.
 * The framework's beam-aligned driver does both (one frame = one PPU field, NMI at the vblank
 * edge), and boots SoE into the intro. SoE-specific frame handling goes here once needed.

 * it came out as noise. The reference renderer (ppu_legacy.c) handles every mode: use it until
