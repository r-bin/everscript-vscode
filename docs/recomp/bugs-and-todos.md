## 1. Open Bugs & Active Investigations

### 1.1 Timing Drift Against snes9x After NMI Counter ~315
- **Status:** **Open Investigation**.
- **Symptoms:**
  WRAM comparison against `snes9x2005-wasm` matches bit-for-bit through NMI counter 305.
  - At counter 315: 4 bytes differ (`$7E0106` brightness shadow, `$7E0128`).
  - At counters 325–335 (intro fade and asset decompression): divergence spikes to 500–2,100 bytes.
  - At counters 345–479: divergence settles at 70–190 bytes (mostly shifted RNG sequence).
- **Findings to Date:**
  - **Identical Across Recomp Modes:** The pure interpreter-only build and the native-variant build
    diverge from snes9x at the **exact same frame counter by the exact same byte counts**.
  - This proves the divergence is **not** caused by recompiled C code. It is an artifact of
    **CPU cycle timing differences** between snes9x2005 and snesrecomp's beam driver during loops
    where NMI is disabled (`$7E0F3A != 0`).
- **How to Fix / Next Steps:**
  1. Compare execution against **Mesen2** (cycle-accurate) to determine which emulator is deviating from
     real SNES hardware timings.
  2. The drift is currently harmless for gameplay, but resolving it will extend automated lockstep verification
     deep into later rooms.

### 1.2 HUD Portrait Tile Overwritten During Combat (OBJ tile `0x81`)
- **Status:** **Open Investigation** (found 2026-10-12, v0.201.18).
- **Symptoms:** after a few fights the Boy's HUD portrait (OAM #0, 16×16 at tile `0x80`, palette 6)
  shows weapon/effect graphics in its upper-right 8×8 tile (`0x81`); it changes again with
  later fights. Reported in play and reproduced headless.
- **Reproduction (deterministic):** continue the SRAM save in Fire Eyes' Village, leave the hut
  south into room `0x38`, lock HP (`forcepoke 4eb3 1e00`, Dog `forcepoke 4f61 2400`) and visit
  each enemy home, swinging ten times per enemy. Hash the 32 bytes at VRAM `$C000 + 0x81*32`
  in each dump: clean is `326e64…`.
- **Findings to Date:**
  - Native build: tile `0x81` is first overwritten during fight 8, then changes with most fights.
  - **All native functions forced into the interpreter** (`SNESRECOMP_LLE_INTERP_TARGET_FILE`
    listing every `func` root in the `$0x/$8x/$Cx` mirrors): overwritten from fight 2. So it is
    **not caused by our generated C**.
  - **snes9x2005** with the same script (`tools/recomp/s9x-run.js`): tile `0x81` never changes in
    all 21 fights. So it is **not a bug of the original game**.
  - At dump time no OAM entry but #0 covers `0x80/0x81/0x90/0x91`: a short-lived sprite (weapon
    swing, damage digits) is given the tile and uploaded there, then released.
  - `$7E50AD` (believed to be the allocation table) stays byte-identical through all fights, so it
    is not where the free tiles are tracked (see its knowledge entry).
- **Next Steps:** the runtime (beam driver interrupt timing, DMA, or the cycle count of the
  interpreter) lets the game's tile allocator see a different state than on hardware. Dump every
  frame around the first overwrite in the interpreter build, find the VRAM upload that writes
  `$D020..$D03F` (DMA source and the allocator's choice), then compare the same moment in snes9x.
- **Not a bug:** the white streaks across the Boy's hair in his hit pose are part of the art
  (ROM character 00, `w_damage` frame 0 has them too).

## 2. Resolved Bugs & Lessons Learned

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix Applied | Architectural Lesson |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Character-name screen rendered as noise** | Screen uses **BG Mode 4** (`$2105 = $04`, 8bpp planar). snesrecomp's default `NewRenderer` only implements modes 0–3, falling back to mode 7. | Injected `SoeAfterConfig()` hook into `src/main.c` setting `g_config.new_renderer = false` to force the legacy reference renderer. | Do not assume visual artifacts originate from code recompilation; always test pure interpreter mode first. |
| **"Press START" screen corrupted in Cycle 2 ("Press : RT")** | Directive `indirect_dispatch 9f46 16 idx:X` at `$8F:9F46` (`jmp ($A3D8,x)`) inside `func_CF9F05`. The loop counter is kept on the 65816 stack via `pha`/`pla` at `$A3B1`. Emitting `indirect_dispatch` generated a native tail call (`RecompStackPop(); return _r;`), popping the native C host call stack frame on each iteration while the emulated SNES stack remained looped. This stack desync corrupted WRAM `$7E:ABDE` (OAM) in Cycle 2. | Added `DISPATCH_EXCLUSIONS` in `src/emulator/cdl/recomp-analysis.js` to exclude `$8F:9F46` (and `$CF:9F46`). Falling back to interpreter executes the loop coherently with no mismatched native pops. Both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 are 100% clean. | Indirect jump directives must not be emitted for jump sites that are internal to a stack-resident loop. |
| **F1 save states could not be restored (black screen / frozen game)** | snesrecomp's file snapshot stores the machine (WRAM, PPU, APU, the legacy interpreter's `Cpu`) but neither `g_cpu` (A/X/Y/S/P/D/DB/PB the recompiled code and the bridge run on) nor the beam driver's resume PC. A load kept the running session's registers and PC under the saved RAM: it only looked right when both moments idled in the same loop (and even then the game logic froze while NMI kept counting); a load before the first frame (resume PC 0) cold-booted from the reset vector on top of the loaded RAM. | `tools/recomp/host/src/game_rtl.c` appends a chunk (`SEXC`: resume PC, WAI flag, `g_cpu` up to `ram`) via `state_save_extra`, reads it in `state_load_extra` and applies it in `on_state_loaded`; `tools/recomp/host.js` adds `snes_beam_frame_driver_{resume_pc,wai_halted,set_resume}` to the scaffold's `beam_frame_driver.c`. Verified: a state saved mid-frame in `$8F:985A` loads at frame 2 and the Boy walks. States written before v0.201.18 carry no chunk and still cannot be restored: load the SRAM save from the title (Continue, B, B) and press F1 again. | A recompiled game's position in its own code is host state; every save/load path must carry it. Test a load both at launch and mid-game, and check that the game *advances* afterwards (`$7E0B19`), not only that a picture appears. |
| **NMI Dynamic Hook Silent Skip Risk (`$80:84BE`)** | Dynamic hook `JML [$0125]` called via `PHK; PEA $84C0` (3-byte return frame, not 2). Emitting `indirect_dispatch ... ptrcall` with only 1 observed target causes snesrecomp to silently skip unobserved runtime callbacks. | Added `0x8084BE` (and `0x0084BE`) to `DISPATCH_EXCLUSIONS` in `src/emulator/cdl/recomp-analysis.js`. | Do not emit static pointer dispatch directives for dynamic hook vectors with incomplete target observations. |
| **Thraxx Attract Demo False-Positive (Frame 2850)** | Comparing raw byte OAM at fixed frame 2850 showed sprite tile 17 instead of 33. Investigation proved native C runs the intro ~4 frames faster than the interpreter (NMI 2671 vs 2675), so the boy's charging animation was simply 4 frames ahead. | Verified intro sequence dynamically over 12,300 frames (`tools/recomp/verify-intro.js`); game modes `0x0DE1` and `0x0DDD` run smoothly and loop cleanly into Cycle 3. | When testing animated scenes, align on game events or NMI counters rather than arbitrary host frame indices. |
| **Sprite Corruption, Overlapping Arm, Missing Portraits & Hair Holes in Attract Demo** | Emitting root `func` directives for dynamic sprite allocator routines (`$80:960A`, `$80:9685`, `$80:96BB`) and direct OAM draw routines (`$80:9033`, `$80:9040`, `$80:8FEE`) caused snesrecomp to merge instructions across `$9040..$96FE` into a single 5,700-line mega-function while compiling `$96BB`'s `JSL $809040` / `PLY` sequence with cross-routine host call frames. Native stack pops desynchronized from the emulated 65816 hardware stack, corrupting sprite allocation indices in `$7E:5127` and `$7E:50AD`. The allocator erroneously assigned body sprite tiles to VRAM slot `0x80` (the HUD portrait slot), resulting in corrupted portrait hair, overlapping arm chunks, dog sprite vertical artifacts, and disappearing HUD portraits when offscreen tiles were assigned. | Added `FUNC_EXCLUSIONS` in `src/emulator/cdl/recomp-analysis.js` and `recomp-seeds.js` to exclude the 6 dynamic sprite allocator routines from being emitted as root `func` lines. Running the sprite allocator in the LLE interpreter preserves exact 65816 stack pushes/pulls, keeping OAM buffer `$7E:ABDE` and VRAM allocations 100% clean across all cycles and scenes. | Tightly coupled routines with internal non-standard stack frames (`PHX; JSL; PLY`) and mutual control flow must not be split into separate native function roots; keep the cluster in the interpreter. |

## 3. Upstream Bug Reports & Contributions

These issues should be submitted to the [RetroPortingToolKit/snesrecomp](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/snesrecomp) repository:

1. **BG Mode 4 Support in `NewRenderer`:**
   - **File:** `runner/src/snes/ppu.c` (`PpuDrawBackgrounds`).
   - **Issue:** Modes 4, 5, and 6 fall through to Mode 7 logic. Secret of Evermore uses Mode 4 for its
     name input screen.
   - **Resolution:** Port Mode 4 drawing logic from `ppu_legacy.c` into `ppu.c`. Once merged, our
     `SoeAfterConfig` hook can be safely removed.
2. **File save states omit the CPU and the beam driver's resume point:** `RtlSaveSnapshot` /
   `RtlLoadSnapshot` (`runner/src/common_rtl.c`) serialize `snes->cpu`, not `g_cpu`, and
   `beam_frame_driver.c` keeps `s_resume_pc` / `s_wai_halted` as statics with no accessor. Any game
   on the beam driver loses its place on load. Our glue works around it (§2); upstream should
   save both and drop the `booting` path when a state was loaded.
3. **Stack-Frame Context Loss in `interp_tier_dispatch_tail`:**
   - **Issue:** When an indirect jump index exceeds the directive count inside a function that has
     allocated stack-frame variables (e.g. via `PEA` or `PHA`), transitioning to the interpreter
     fallback can misalign the stack frame, causing corrupt return addresses or register loads.

### Milestone 1: Headless Intro & Attract Mode Across Cycles (COMPLETED)
- Verified over 12,300 frames (~3.4 minutes emulated) via `tools/recomp/verify-intro.js`.
- Boot -> Squaresoft logo -> Intro story cutscene -> Title screen ("Press START") -> Attract demo (Thraxx fight).
- Loops cleanly from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2 (~frame 6164), runs Cycle 2 with identical 100% clean sprites/OAM, and loops into Cycle 3 (~frame 12250).
- Excluded stack-resident loop dispatcher `$8F:9F46` and dynamic hook `$80:84BE` in `src/emulator/cdl/recomp-analysis.js`.

### Milestone 2: Automated In-Game Playthrough
- Write a headless script that presses Start at the title screen, accepts default names, and loads
  the opening cutscene and first playable room (`room_00`, Podunk).
- Extend `lockstep.js` to verify WRAM integrity across player movement and weapon swings.

### Milestone 3: High-Level Emulation (HLE) Replacements (`hle_func`)
- snesrecomp supports replacing any recompiled routine with a clean C implementation using `hle_func <pc16> <c_func_name>`.
- Replace the leaf routines first:
  1. LZ decompressors (`src/maps/` already has verified TypeScript decoders).
  2. Room tilemap loader and collision unpacker.
- Lockstep WRAM comparison validates that hand-written C behaves identically to the original 65816 assembly.

### Milestone 4: Broaden Static CDL Coverage
- Use Ghidra / REA headless exports (`static.json`) to seed unplayed routines, raising native C
  coverage from ~10% toward 100%.
